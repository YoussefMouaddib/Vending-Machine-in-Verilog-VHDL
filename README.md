<h1 style="20: 36px;">Vending Machine in Verilog & VHDL</h1>

![alt text](/Users/youssefmouaddib/Documents/screenshot1.png)
This project implements a simple digital logic vending machine using Verilog and DigitalJS. 

This vending machine project could be useful for learning digital logic, Verilog, and DigitalJS. 
It could also be extended to include additional features, such as a product inventory, a coin dispenser, or a user interface with buttons and LEDs.
Please Read pdf File for more information on how this project works.
